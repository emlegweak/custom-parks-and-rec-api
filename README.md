# Parks and Recreation Characters API
Love Parks and Rec and need information about your favorite characters for your frontend, backend, or fullstack web apps? Look no further! I have created Ron's worst nightmare, a Parks and Rec API with information about many recurring characters in the series from all seasons.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express

## Optimizations

No huge refactoring/optimization undertakings yet, but I hope to have the database itself hosted on MongoDB in the near future and to provide more information for each character (image sprites, etc.).

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest takeaway from this experience was definitely deploying to Heroku. By working with a combination of the remote repository on GitHub and the deployment of the application on Heroku, I got a lot of experience making commits/pushes and experimenting with various middlewares.
